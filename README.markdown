---
### Feature complete

Idiorm is now considered to be feature complete as of version 1.4.0. Whilst it will continue to be maintained with bug fixes there will be no further new features added.

---

A lightweight nearly-zero-configuration object-relational mapper and fluent query builder for PHP5.

Tested on PHP 5.2.0+ - may work on earlier versions with PDO and the correct database drivers.

Released under a [BSD license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses).

**See Also: [Paris](http://github.com/j4mie/paris), an Active Record implementation built on top of Idiorm.**

Features
--------

* Makes simple queries and simple CRUD operations completely painless.
* Gets out of the way when more complex SQL is required.
* Built on top of [PDO](http://php.net/pdo).
* Uses [prepared statements](http://uk.php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php) throughout to protect against [SQL injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) attacks.
* Requires no model classes, no XML configuration and no code generation: works out of the box, given only a connection string.
* Consists of one main class called `ORM`. Additional classes are prefixed with `Idiorm`. Minimal global namespace pollution.
* Database agnostic. Currently supports SQLite, MySQL, Firebird and PostgreSQL. May support others, please give it a try!
* Supports collections of models with method chaining to filter or apply actions to multiple results at once.
* Multiple connections supported
* PSR-1 compliant methods (any method can be called in camelCase instead of underscores eg. `find_many()` becomes `findMany()`) - you'll need PHP 5.3+

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is hosted on Read the Docs: [idiorm.rtfd.org](http://idiorm.rtfd.org)

### Building the Docs ###

You will need to install [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) and then in the docs folder run:

    make html

The documentation will now be in docs/_build/html/index.html

Let's See Some Code
-------------------

```php
$user = ORM::for_table('user')
    ->where_equal('username', 'j4mie')
    ->find_one();

$user->first_name = 'Jamie';
$user->save();

$tweets = ORM::for_table('tweet')
    ->select('tweet.*')
    ->join('user', array(
        'user.id', '=', 'tweet.user_id'
    ))
    ->where_equal('user.username', 'j4mie')
    ->find_many();

foreach ($tweets as $tweet) {
    echo $tweet->text;
}
```

#### 1.4.1 - release 2013-12-12
